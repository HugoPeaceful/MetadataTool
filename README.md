# MetadataTool
This GitHub repository is a powerful tool for anyone who needs to clean up metadata, write compelling copy, and read content efficiently. This is an addon for people who are too lazy to learn how to use exiftool. (Exiftool is too annoying)

# How to use

1. Open metadatatool.bat
2. Put file or folder you want to read, write (etc)
3. First time is strange so when you choose option just press enter until result.
4. Done
